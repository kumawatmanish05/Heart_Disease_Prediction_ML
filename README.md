# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can save lives, and with the help of **machine learning**, we can analyze patient health data to predict the risk of heart disease.  
This project builds a **classification model** to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes such as **Age, Sex, Cholesterol, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, and more**.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
- To develop a **predictive model** that can accurately classify patients into **heart disease** or **no heart disease** categories.  
- To analyze **key health indicators** and their correlation with heart disease.  
- To provide **data-driven insights** for better healthcare decisions.  

---

## ✨ Key Points  
- Dataset includes **11 health-related features** + target variable (`HeartDisease`).  
- Applied **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training**.  
- Tested multiple ML models and evaluated performance.  
- Achieved insights on which features are most important in predicting heart disease.  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights  
📍 **Age & Max Heart Rate** play a major role in predictions.  
📍 Patients with **high cholesterol & high resting BP** are at greater risk.  
📍 **Chest Pain Type** and **ST Slope** strongly influence predictions.  
📍 Lifestyle factors such as **exercise-induced angina** are critical indicators.
